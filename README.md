EECS 280 (Programming and Introduction to Data Structures): <br />
Project 3: Computer Vision and Image Rendering <br />
**Utilized seam carving algorithm to develop a image resizing algorithm <br />
that is aware of the image's content to pass-through less important pixels <br />
and ensure integrity of the actual image details. <br />
<br />
Project 5: Machine Learning and NLP for Forum Post Classification <br />
**Developed model using conditional probabilities to label forum posts based on their <br />
content. Fed historical training data into model in order to find probabilities of labels <br /> 
containing words from past forum posts and used these probabilities to generate labels for new posts. <br />
