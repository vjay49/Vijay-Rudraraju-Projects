**EECS 280 (Programming and Introduction to Data Structures):** <br />
Project 3: Computer Vision and Image Rendering <br />
**Utilized seam carving algorithm to develop a image resizing algorithm <br />
that is aware of the image's content to pass-through less important pixels <br />
and ensure integrity of the actual image details <br />
<br />
Project 5: Machine Learning and NLP for Forum Post Classification <br />
**Developed model using conditional probabilities to label forum posts based on their <br />
content. Fed historical training data into model in order to find probabilities of labels <br /> 
containing words from past forum posts and used these probabilities to generate labels for new posts. <br />
<br />
<br />
**EECS 281 (Data Structures and Algorithms):** <br />
Project 3: Log File Management and Database Query Language <br />
**Worked with hash tables and larger data structures by reviewing log files <br />
and understanding query language <br />
<br />
<br />
**EECS 484 (Database Management Systems):** <br />
Project 1: Creating Data Tables and Adding Contraints <br />
**Used SQL DDL statements to create and drop tables and views <br />
based on schema put forth by the course. Essentially created a "mock" <br />
facebook database with all the appropriate integrity constraints <br />
<br />
Project 2: SQL Queries and Oracle DBMS Usage: <br />
**Created SQL queries and through Java, I was able to execute these queries <br />
on top of the mock facebook database by using Oracle's DBMS <br />
<br />
Project 3: MongoDB NoSQL DBMS: <br />
**Translated the above queries into scripts for the MongoDB DBMS <br />
while also performing other required queries using Javascript and .find() <br />
statements <br />
<br />
Project 4: Grace Hash Join: <br />
**Essentially implemented the partitioning and probing algorithm for Grace Hash Join, <br />
creating a backend implementation for JOIN statements that DBMSs utilize to increase <br />
efficiencies. Worked to create hash tables and kept memory management in mind <br />
<br />
<br />
**Pet Services Demand Model:** <br />
**Created a demand model for the pet services industry based on industry factors that <br />
contribute to pet demand for a zip code location. This involves scraping data from industry <br />
sources and creating a weighting systems to rank zip codes relative to each other based on <br />
potential/predicted demand. This model was eventually integrated into Tableau to create a <br />
mapped visual representation of both current and future demand for the industry per location <br />
